# Roni
The top graph displayed shows total orders placed per month.
The bottom left chart shows the average prediction hour by hour through the week of meals ordered for the most popular dishes during schools months.
The bottom right chart takes input from the bottom three boxes allowing the user to make a prediction at a specific hour and day.
This will allow the manager at Roni's to predicate how much of each dish should be prepared in advance for each hour to allow for fresh food and quick
customer service.
